Hi! I'm an undergraduate student at the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, where my area of concentration is [probability](https://pkuprobability.com/studies/undergraduate/).

My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science, probability and combinatorics.
