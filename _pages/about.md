Hi! I'm an undergraduate student at the [School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/), where my area of concentration is [probability](https://pkuprobability.com/studies/undergraduate/).

My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science, probability theory and combinatorics.
