Hi! I'm a graduate student in the [theory of computation](https://toc.csail.mit.edu/) group at MIT, very fortunate to be advised by Dor Minzer and Ronitt Rubinfeld. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University. I'm deeply grateful to Professors Xi Chen, Jian Ding, and Pinyan Lu for their guidance and support during my undergraduate years.
